# Verzamelwoede V2 - Collection Management System üì¶üîç

Welcome to the Verzamelwoede V2 Collection Management System repository! This project is designed to help collectors keep track of their prized collections, ensuring they never lose sight of what they have. 

## Assignment Context üìã

**Collector's Challenge**

For avid collectors, managing and organizing collections is a delightful yet challenging task. The Verzamelwoede V2 project aims to solve these collection-related challenges:

- Collection Management: Keep track of your collections efficiently and organize them by name, category, and other attributes.

- Item Tracking: Record and describe individual items within your collections, including details like name and description.

- Category Sorting: Easily sort and categorize your collections based on your preferences.

- Editing Simplicity: Allow users to edit and manage their collections and items with user-friendly interfaces.

## Project Structure üèóÔ∏è

‚ö†Ô∏è **Development in Progress**: This project represents an ongoing development effort to create a user-friendly system for collectors. It is a work in progress and will continue to evolve to meet your collecting needs.

Here's an organized project structure for your Verzamelwoede V2 project:

- **Controllers**: Handle incoming HTTP requests and manage the application's logic.
    - `CollectionsController`: Manages operations related to collections.
    - `CategoriesController`: Handles category-related actions.
    - `ItemsController`: Manages individual items within collections.

- **Views**: Render HTML templates and present data to users. Views are organized by their respective controllers.
    - `Collections Views`: Views related to collection operations.
    - `Categories Views`: Views for category management.
    - `Items Views`: Views for individual item management.

- **Models**: Represent the data structure of your application and are mapped to the database.
    - `Collection Model`: Represents collection data and attributes.
    - `Category Model`: Represents category information for sorting.
    - `Item Model`: Represents individual item information.

- **Data**: Contains the Entity Framework context classes and database migration files.

- **wwwroot**: Store static files like JavaScript, CSS, and images for enhancing the user interface.

- **Tests (optional)**: Create folders for unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality.

## Development Steps üìù
