<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<p>At Verzamelwoede V2, we take your privacy seriously... but not too seriously. We promise to protect your data like a dragon guards its treasure, but without the fire-breathing part. Here's our privacy policy in plain English:</p>

<h2>1. What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
<p>We collect only the information you willingly provide while using our platform. We're not interested in your secret cookie recipes or your best knock-knock jokes, just your collection data.</p>

<h2>2. How Do We Use Your Information?</h2>
<p>We use your collection data to make sure you can manage your treasures with ease. We won't sell your collection of vintage bobbleheads to the highest bidder. Your secrets are safe with us.</p>

<h2>3. Data Security</h2>
<p>We take security seriously. Our virtual moat is always filled, and our digital drawbridge is up. We use the latest encryption technology to protect your data from prying eyes.</p>

<h2>4. Sharing Information</h2>
<p>We won't share your collection details with anyone unless you explicitly give us permission. Even then, we'll ask nicely and offer a virtual cup of tea.</p>

<h2>5. Cookies (the digital kind)</h2>
<p>We do use cookies to make your experience smoother. But we promise we won't eat your chocolate chip cookies without asking first.</p>

<h2>6. Updates and Changes</h2>
<p>Our privacy policy may evolve like your collection. If we make any significant changes, we'll let you know. We promise it won't be as dramatic as a season finale.</p>

<h2>7. Questions?</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about our privacy policy or just want to chat about your collection, feel free to reach out to <a href="mailto:2206241reinartz@zuyd.nl">Jaymian-Lee Reinartz 2206241</a>. I don't bite.</p>

<p>Remember, we're here to make your collecting experience more enjoyable, not to collect your personal secrets. So, go forth and continue curating your collection with Verzamelwoede V2!</p>
